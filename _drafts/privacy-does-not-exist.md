I sometimes watch videos from a youtuber called Exurb1a. He mixes up existencialism, physics, science, sci-fi, philosophy, thought experiments and story-telling. Really a lot of what I like in a single youtuber.

In one of the videos I watched recently, he was speaking from the point of view of someone who lived in the long-term future, and mentioned that these old backwards humans had expectations of privacy in their lives.

I brushed it away as a single joke at first, but it stuck with me. I think he might be right.

The joke itself wasn't really funny. And he did not explain further why the expectation of privacy was flawed, he just proceeded to ramble about other "outdated" things that we consider desirable.

## Advertising

A few days later, I came back to one of the projects I'm working on, and I work with not one, not two, but _five_ companies who core business relies on somehow _breaching_ user's privacy. Mind you, it's not what it sounds when you use that word but it is still true. Their business is to find out information about you (sometimes by asking permission, sometime by finding out in other ways) in order to sell you products, or to allow others to sell you.

This issue with privacy is not what you would think when we think about privacy problems. Advertising companies don't really care how are you called, where do you live, how old you are and how much do you make. They care about what those datapoints mean for their business.

- How are you called? --> Are you of a particular ethnicity? Do you celebrate particular holidays? Can we sell you thematic stuff related to it? Are there products that you'll never buy because of traditional reasons?
- Where do you live? --> Are there companies, retail stores, entertainment near you that you're more likely to consume? Is the location you live in very leaning towards certain ideologies? What language is spoken there? What's the infrastructure in those places, and what equipment will you need to buy to live in there?
- How old are you? --> What will your interests be, in regards to your points in life? What is something likely you'll be looking for? Are you a child mostly interested in getting through school? A teenager interested in music? A grown up dealing with mortgages?
- How much do you make? --> How much you can affort, what level of life do you likely have and what do others hold in that regards as a display of status? 

### Big advertising with shared IDs

As you imagine, no-one will agree to give these companies this level of detail about their lives. It just feels unsafe. (And it is!) So these companies, instead, rely on multiple data points that they can somehow correlate.

The first correlation that we all know about is cookies. Those tracking cookies that giants like Google will use in almost every website. Websites use Google's systems because they're giants, and they're giants because every website uses them. So, their cookie tells them where have you been. Not only the website but the specific URL, which might include specifics like product information.

Now, we don't like cookies anymore, and while most keep using them, the same approach works in multiple other platforms. IDFA, IDFV (Apple) and GAID (Google) is pretty much the same concept. Your app requests an identifier that says nothing about you, expect that your app is using them. A giant ad company can get that one, and will find that they got the same ID from Candy Crush and Fruit Ninja. They will deduce we found ourselves a casual gamer, and is ready to start serving the right ads to this person.

## Correlations

But let's say there's nothing tracking you. You are a concious privacy user, you use DuckDuckGo for your browsing, you disable cookies and javascript whenever you can. You use SSL only for your websites.

You can STILL be tracked by information that you do not fully control. DNS requests? Will let us know if you're visiting Facebook, or Instagram, or using Whatsapp.

Or your IP address will leak out, as long as we have access to the server logs of several companies, we can see that your IP 123.123.123.123 happened to visit facebook.com and instagram.com 20 minutes later while facebook.com stopped receiving requests from it.

You use proxies? Fine, we won't get your real IP address, but we still know there's someone that visits facebook.com and instagram.com 20 minutes later, every day at 6 pm.

This all sounds too far-fetching, but it is not. Maybe of the big companies working on advertising really do have access to this information and more. There are laws that will prevent companies from passing around your private information but as you've seen, this is not private and it's not your information at all. It's _their_ information about _your_ usage of their services, and that makes it fair play.

Besides, it's not like standards, good practices or even the law will prevent someone from just selling data, breaching it accidentally or plainly putting it out there. It has happened before, and it will happen again. Equifax, I'm looking at you.

## "Nothing to hide"

I will **not** be one of those people arguing that "if you've done nothing wrong, you've got nothing to hide". I know it doesn't work like that, because privacy is not a problem until the information is in the wrong hands, and wrong hands will always get a turn at it. Companies, governments, authoritarian regimes or plain trolls can misuse that power.

In an "ideal" world, privacy would not be needed. But we don't live in an ideal world, so we do need it.

However, I suspect it might be a losing battle that we're fighting. Real privacy and anonimity comes with a lot of drawbacks that many of us are not willing to accept realistically. Targeted ads are useful, recommended posts are cozy, our information bubble is nice to stay in.

## What should we do?
