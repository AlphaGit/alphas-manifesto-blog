There are a couple of subjects in web design and web development that will never grow old. One of them is this one: rich text editing. At least until browsers and web standards include a way for rich text editing to be done on the client side, there will be custom implementations through JavaScript and HTML markup that will provide users of WYSIWYG editors.

So, [Plug-ins for rich text editors on your website](http://www.tutkiun.com/2010/08/plug-ins-for-rich-text-editors-on-your.html) is an article with a nice collection of different plugins and options you may use to provide that functionality, but still there are [many many options](http://www.google.com/search?q=wysiwyg+rich+text+editor).

Which one are you closer to? Any specific advantage or disadvantage that plugin provides?

_I'm a WYSIWYG little skunk._
