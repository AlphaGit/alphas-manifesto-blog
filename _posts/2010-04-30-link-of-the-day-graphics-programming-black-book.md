I don't know if you agree with me, but graphics programming is something I always wanted to learn &ndash; and will eventually do it someday. For that, we need a book that is as explicative as possible and detailed, going through every concept and being insightful on the concepts.  Luckily, I found a web holding a full online version of [Graphics Programming Black Book](http://www.gamedev.net/reference/articles/article1698.asp), a full featured book with really deep explanations and concepts.

It goes through optimization techniques and source code examples, even with 3D rendering and known examples as Doom or Quake graphic engines. You may see that the book is quite extensive, and good it is, for 70 short chapters we can really grasp the concepts and get hands to work on C++ and ASM in order to make our graphic programming.

_I'm a graphic little skunk._
