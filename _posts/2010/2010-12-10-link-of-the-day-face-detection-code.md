Well, face recognitions systems are not actually the last thing in technology, but still may be something new for us who couldn't have a grasp of it and try it out in our own code. Of course, maybe we're not fancy enough to come up with an algorithm out of ourselves and may just have ideas to use it, not to develop it.

For us then, we can go ahead and try [Face Detection in any language](http://www.tutkiun.com/2010/12/face-detection-in-any-language.html), a blog post from Tukiun referring to [OpenCV](http://opencv.willowgarage.com/wiki/), the Open Computer Vision library that will allow us to make image processing something simple. It has been ported to different languages so it is sure that some of them will be suitable for us.
