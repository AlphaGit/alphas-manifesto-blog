I just found out that the "Start page" for Visual Studio can really provide nice interesting articles and news. It's there where I found a link to an unfinished series of posts called [Parallel Programming](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/csharpfaq/archive/tags/parallel_2d00_programming/). These are part of the [C# Frequently Asked Questions](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/csharpfaq/) blog, one of the very interesting blogs around the MSDN.

These specific posts I mentioned are some techniques that we can take advantage of in C# (of course, VB also applies) to easily develop multi-thread applications without struggling with the bared thread objects. Of course, being based in .NET Framework 4, we have a lot of new features we can take advantage of.

Happy Friday to all!
