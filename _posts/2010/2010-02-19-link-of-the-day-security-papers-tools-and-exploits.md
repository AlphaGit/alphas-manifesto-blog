It's been a while now I'm following the RSS feed of a site called [Exploit-DB](http://www.exploit-db.com/). In fact, this site was created by [Offensive Security](http://www.offensive-security.com/), the same guys that are the creators of Backtrack, the widely-known Linux distribution for penetration testing and security auditing.

What I like most of the site are the [papers](http://www.exploit-db.com/papers). Most of them are truly enlightening and even inspiring. The last ones I've read are [Inyección SQL en MSSQL - HackTimes](http://www.exploit-db.com/download_pdf/11418), [[Spanish] PFD - Partial Function Disclosure](http://www.exploit-db.com/download_pdf/11313) and [The (in)security of Omegle - What Omegle users should know](http://www.exploit-db.com/download_pdf/11386). All of the papers are easy to understand and well documented, even with pictures and examples of what they talk about.

Not so far from here, I found the site called [HackTimes](http://www.hacktimes.com/), with lots of articles to read about security measures, hacking techniques, ideas and more. I've just read an article about [Fuzzy Hashing](http://www.hacktimes.com/fuzzy_hashing/) and it seems totally interesting.

_I'm a secure little skunk._
