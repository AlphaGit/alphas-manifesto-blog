I've been looking into some documentation on how testable code should be written. They all say pretty much the same, but I found [this article](http://www.methodsandtools.com/archive/archive.php?id=103) by Isa Goksu which is quite extensive on some particular points, and also provides a good linking to other related articles. He mentions concepts that are closely related to testing and test-driven development, like [The Simplest Thing that Could Possibly Work](http://www.artima.com/intv/simplest.html), or [Law of Demeter](http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/lieber/LoD.html) (which is a good design pattern too), some not-as-spread-as-they-should-be [Principles of Object Oriented Design](http://butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob.PrinciplesOfOod), and so on.

Remember we also have [Google Testing blog](http://googletesting.blogspot.com/) where sometimes guidelines about testing and good testable code is engineered.

Hope it's a testable Friday for you!
