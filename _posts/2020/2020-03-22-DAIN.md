About a month ago, a Youtube video crossed my path. It was a video by the Lumi√®re brothers (1896), but in full 4k, 60fps. No wonder, this caught my attention, and of course, I wondered how can we make this more accesible to poeple.

Before we move forward, you can take a look at the video yourself.

The video is pretty impressive, and it looks incredibly recent even though it's not. 

So... how did we get to a real-life version of the so-hated futuristic "enhance"?

The creator ([Denis Shiryaev](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCD8J_xbbBuGobmw_N5ga3MA)) took several steps from the original:

## Upscaling

Upscaling is the name given to an expansion of the source. In the case of videos, it means adding more pixels to each of the images of the original video. The difficult part is finding out which colors do the pixels need to be so that the shapes are preserved, or so that the textures look natural. It's not the same thing adding pixels to a picture of a plain green wall (fairly easy) than adding pixels to a low-resolution face (very difficult).

For this, the [TopazLabs Gigapixel AI](https://topazlabs.com/gigapixel-ai/) product was used. 

## Colorization

Not the case for this video, but when dealing with old media, it's very likely that colors need to be restored. This has the same challenges as upscaling: when looking at an old video, where the information stored is in shades of grey, which color should each pixel have? That's not an easy question.

## Interpolation

And finally, interpolation is needed. Interpolation is calculating a middle unknown-data point from other existing data points.

I'll expand a bit more on this particular concept.
