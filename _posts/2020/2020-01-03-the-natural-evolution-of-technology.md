sub_title: Is there such a thing? I believe there is.
---

I recently read this wonderful article from Vox called _[The biggest lie tech people tell themselves â€” and the rest of us](https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/2019/10/1/20887003/tech-technology-evolution-natural-inevitable-ethics)_. In it, they propose that the progress we're making in technology, with the debates in ethics and in the erosion of privacy is usually justified by people with mantras like "it's the natural evolution of technology" and "it's the way progress works" and "it was going to happen eventually". They propose that it is not such a thing.

I disagree.

## Humanity as environments for technology to be naturally selected

One of the primary points made is that natural evolution doesn't work in the way that the technological "evolution" works. They propose counter examples on how the process of natural selection is radically different from the forces driving the technology forward. A good example is that evolution does not lobby for companies' interests. The point is well made in the phrase: _"[evolution...] makes mistakes, not plans"_.

And while that is true, I think the plans that our companies and our interests make are **not** what drives the progress of technology. It is the survival of a particular technology or practice, their adaptation to our society and the acceptance that they get, the reproduction that allow them to become viral from person to person and make it a daily thing... **that** is what makes technology move forward. In a general sense of technology as a practice that as humankind we will cultivate and proceed with, the technology does need to be "naturally" selected.

Take an example: weren't mp3 players already around and alive until the iPod became the standard? What made the iPod stand out? Regardless of your answer, anything else had to be compared to the iPod from there on. The product made it so it survived the general trend of any other product/technology that existed, and became something that was allowed to mutate further, mostly into the iPhones that we still brand today.

Yes, corporations and their interest had something to do with that. But weren't they always? Didn't Microsoft also pour millions into making Zune **the** mp3 player that would go down in history? Apple probably did something different, and did something well. Maybe it was just timing. Maybe it's luck. Whatever it is, one of them survived and passed on its genes, one of them didn't.

Similar things happen with any kind of technology. The examples that the article mentions are just fads that come and go -- I think they're missing to see the bigger picture.

If we can consider technology as a set of adopted "inventions" that we have, in a majority of population, allowed into our lives, then each invention (organism) has to fight for their survival. Eventually, some of them are good enough that they stay (adaptation), or groundbreaking enough that they solve a new problem (mutation). As such, we keep changing and adapting new technologies.

This is natural selection.
