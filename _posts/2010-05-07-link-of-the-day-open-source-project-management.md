I spend the first days of this week searching for a good issue tracker with hosted services. Unfortunately, I couldn't find any that wasn't paid, or that didn't force you to share your code with everyone and/or upload the code as well. I ended up using <a href="http://flyspray.org/">Flyspray</a>, a PHP-based issue tracker, even when I would have preferred another options (like <a href="http://www.bugzilla.org/">Bugzilla</a> or <a href="http://trac.edgewall.org/">Trac</a>).

Anyway, that led me to a Wikipedia page called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_issue-tracking_systems">Comparison of Issue Tracking Systems</a>, which is a good way to make a decision based on what you need and what you can use/pay.

Of course, there's also a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_project_management_software">Comparison of Project Management Software</a>, and among the products listed there, a lot of them are open source and free. Masters In Project Management (Mr Master) also makes a review of the <a href="http://mastersinprojectmanagement.org/top-25-open-source-project-management-apps.html">Top 25 Open Source Project Management Apps</a>.

_I'm a managed little skunk._
