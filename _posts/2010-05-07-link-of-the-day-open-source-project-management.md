I spend the first days of this week searching for a good issue tracker with hosted services. Unfortunately, I couldn't find any that wasn't paid, or that didn't force you to share your code with everyone and/or upload the code as well. I ended up using [Flyspray](http://flyspray.org/), a PHP-based issue tracker, even when I would have preferred another options (like [Bugzilla](http://www.bugzilla.org/) or [Trac](http://trac.edgewall.org/)).

Anyway, that led me to a Wikipedia page called [Comparison of Issue Tracking Systems](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_issue-tracking_systems), which is a good way to make a decision based on what you need and what you can use/pay.

Of course, there's also a [Comparison of Project Management Software](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_project_management_software), and among the products listed there, a lot of them are open source and free. Masters In Project Management (Mr Master) also makes a review of the [Top 25 Open Source Project Management Apps](http://mastersinprojectmanagement.org/top-25-open-source-project-management-apps.html).

_I'm a managed little skunk._
