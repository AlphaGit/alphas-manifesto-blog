<p style="text-align: justify;">Remember that <a href="https://blog.alphasmanifesto.com/2010/08/24/link-del-dia-la-belleza-de-los-algoritmos/">link where I spoke about different algorithms</a>? I made a quick reference to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-d2-PtK4F6Y">Pixel City</a>. If you had the chance to see it, and furthermore, if you have had the chance to download it and test it yourself, you might have seen that for a really little binary executable we can get really great things.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">That's because of content <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_generation">procedural generation</a>, this means that the data you see is not configured or saved anywhere, it is just created in the moment that it is needed, with a set of rules that make sure that the result is close as expected.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Of course, this isn't something new, lots of games already make use of this technique and not even that, there are a couple of games made entirely on this fashion. You should check out <a href="http://www.theprodukkt.com/kkrieger">.kkrieger</a>, a 96k 3D full level FPS game. That's right. 96k.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You should also check <a href="http://www.greatgamesexperiment.com/game/synth">Synth</a>, an almost 100% procedural generated game, where even the music is generated in real time.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There's also a nice experiment with procedural animation and genetic algorithms called <a href="http://www.tecgraf.puc-rio.br/~pluchini/?section=projects#proc_anim">Creepy Crawlies</a>. In this application, you can create a creature with a certain configuration of bones (fixed length), claws (points it can grab on to) and muscles (parts it can expand/collapse), and the genetic algorithms will make it evolve so it grows up to the best locomotion technique. The animation is done procedurally too.</p>
