It's been a while now I'm following the RSS feed of a site called <a href="http://www.exploit-db.com/">Exploit-DB</a>. In fact, this site was created by <a href="http://www.offensive-security.com/">Offensive Security</a>, the same guys that are the creators of Backtrack, the widely-known Linux distribution for penetration testing and security auditing.

What I like most of the site are the <a href="http://www.exploit-db.com/papers">papers</a>. Most of them are truly enlightening and even inspiring. The last ones I've read are <a href="http://www.exploit-db.com/download_pdf/11418">Inyección SQL en MSSQL - HackTimes</a>, <a href="http://www.exploit-db.com/download_pdf/11313">[Spanish] PFD - Partial Function Disclosure</a> and <a href="http://www.exploit-db.com/download_pdf/11386">The (in)security of Omegle - What Omegle users should know</a>. All of the papers are easy to understand and well documented, even with pictures and examples of what they talk about.

Not so far from here, I found the site called <a href="http://www.hacktimes.com/">HackTimes</a>, with lots of articles to read about security measures, hacking techniques, ideas and more. I've just read an article about <a href="http://www.hacktimes.com/fuzzy_hashing/">Fuzzy Hashing</a> and it seems totally interesting.

_I'm a secure little skunk._
