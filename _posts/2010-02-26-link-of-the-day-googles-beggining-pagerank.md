<p style="text-align: justify;">I think that most of you already know the story: <a href="http://www.google.com">Google</a> started as an academic project, and in that project, they introduced several new ideas that were used to detect the "relevant" pages among a great number of them. That is what we today know as PageRank.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">However, have any of you read the original paper they made? If not, you can take a look at it here, it is called <a href="http://infolab.stanford.edu/~backrub/google.html">The Anatomy of a Large-Scale Hypertextual Web Search Engine</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Besides that, the Wikipedia holds a great amount of information and examples on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank">PageRank</a>, and how does the algorithm works. We know that this has been improved over the years and that not all the details are public until now, but Google helps us by uploading lots of information on different sites, like <a href="http://www.youtube.com/profile?user=GoogleWebmasterHelp">GoogleWebMasterHelp user profile on Youtube</a>, <a href="http://www.google.com/webmasters/">Google Webmaster Central</a> (home of the webmaster tools), and the <a href="http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.com/">Google Official Webmaster Central Blog</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I know, yes, they help us to do something on they way they like to be on a listing they made. Sounds circular, but they've done lots of things and if we want to get to the people, they are a really good shot.</p>
