Once ago I [published some information](({{ site.baseUrl }}{% link _posts/2008-08-05-link-del-dia-la-maquina-de-emociones.md %})) about Marvin Minsky's book, _The Emotion Machine_, but I never had the chance to get to read it deeply. Finally, with time flying by, I kept on crawling through along the pages.

The book itself it extremely interesting, but sadly the online version has lots of quirks that makes us realize it is just a draft prior to publication, due to some of the poor explanation of certain concepts, but it still is quite understandable, always full of practical and simple examples and explanations that allow us to comprehend the concept being developed.

The first chapter, _Emotional States_ proposes the theory that will be developed further in the remaining parts of the book: some cognitive sciences may fail because they want the explain mind's behavior with simple rules, whilst probably it is really more complex than these rules may call. Then, why not treat it as a complex related element combination?

The idea of _resources_ is introduced here, which are (according to its theory) elements that produce certain responses on human behavior, and each resource may in turn generate action on another ones. As time goes by and we learn to control ourselves, these resources will have their relationships enhanced or decreased, that would define our personality. Strong emotions that those that arise more resources, o that generate great intensity cascades, letting out those resources that are more manifested in us.

Second chapter, _Attachments and Goals_ speaks further on this, about the way we learn to link certain behaviors to certain situations. The concept of planification is introduced here, the achieving of sub-goals subjugated to primary goals, and the concept of _imprimer_, as that external agent that we'll accept the reward or the reproach in order to modify our conduct. Finally, it contrasts them against the concepts of models or fictional imprimers that model our behavior on different ways.

The third chapter, _From Pain to Suffering_ starts with some of what the first chapter dealed with: How is it that a strng emotion arises many different sensations? How is it that a strong emotion or sensation may makes us loose the notion of where we are standing or what are we doing? What's the benefit of all this? Also some of how a resource may activate anothers and how mind may induce us to certain states helpful to us is detailed here, although the explanation on how the mind may learn about the relation between resources and how is it self-aware on its inner working is still missing. Finally, a contraposition between Freud's counscience theories and the activating resources theory is described.

That's how much I've managed to get on with my reading on this book, but I hope to be able to continue it soon.

_I'm a resourceful little skunk._
